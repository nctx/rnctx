The extension `nctx` provides functionality to analyze attributed networks. Unique feature of this extension is the ability to enforce contextual constraints via user-defined functions during shortest path discovery and centrality calculation. More info and full documentation can be found [here](https://nctx.mircoschoenfeld.de/R/)

The source code is accessible [on github](https://github.com/nctx/rnctx).

## Installation

You can install the released version of nctx from [github](https://github.com/nctx/rnctx) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("nctx/rnctx")
```

## Example

This is a basic example of how to process attributed networks. For the creation of the graph, there are three choices: create the graph from scratch, load it from a file (in the [GraphML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML) format), or copy it from [igraph](https://igraph.org/r/).

This example shows how to do things from scratch.
```r
require(nctx)

g <- create_graph(directed=FALSE)

# This instantiates the network proposed in
# Ulrik Brandes, Jan Hildebrand: Smallest graphs with distinct singleton centers, 
# Network Science 2 (2014), 3., S. 416-418
sapply(1:10,function(x){add_vertex(g)})
add_edge(g, 1, 2)
add_edge(g, 2, 3)
add_edge(g, 3, 4)
add_edge(g, 4, 5)
add_edge(g, 3, 5)
add_edge(g, 5, 9)
add_edge(g, 6, 4)
add_edge(g, 7, 4)
add_edge(g, 2, 6)
add_edge(g, 8, 2)
add_edge(g, 9, 4)
add_edge(g, 3, 10)
add_edge(g, 10, 5)
add_edge(g, 10, 9)
```

![The example graph](inst/extdata/minbcd.png)

Next to our graph we create a list of attributes or context information
```r
context <- c(1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0)
```

This is a very simple example of a `bool`-attriute associated with each node (the third entry in this list yields the attribute of the third vertex in `g` and so on).

The unique feature of `nctx` comes here: **Define a function that is evaluated at each node during shortest path discovery**. Therefore, the function has to accept three parameters: the start vertex, the current, and the next vertex. It must evaluate to bool in order to guide edge traversal. 
```r
decision_fct <- function(strt, crnt, nxt){
  context[crnt] == context[nxt]
}
```

Here, we use an edge only if its source and end vertex have the same context information assigned:
```r
path <- find_path_ctx(g, 1, 7, decision_fct)
```

![The example graph with the shortest path from 1 to 7 highlighted](inst/extdata/minbcd_path.png)

The shortest path from `1` to `7` is:
```
[1] 1 2 6 4 7
```
The edge `2` -> `3` was not visited because of contextual constraints: `context[2] != context[3]`.

For this example of shortest path discovery from start to target, passing the start vertex to the decision function is unnecessary. However, the signature of this function is consistent for all shortest-path- and centrality-related functionality. It becomes clear for the discovery of **all** shortest paths in the network. Here, we need the start vertex to know the vertex for which shortest paths are discovered:
```r
distances <- all_pairs_shortest_paths_ctx(g, decision_fct)
```

The result is a distance matrix:
```
      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
 [1,]    0    1  Inf    3    4    2    4  Inf    4   Inf
 [2,]    1    0  Inf    2    3    1    3  Inf    3   Inf
 [3,]  Inf  Inf    0  Inf  Inf  Inf  Inf  Inf  Inf     1
 [4,]    3    2  Inf    0    1    1    1  Inf    1   Inf
 [5,]    4    3  Inf    1    0    2    2  Inf    1   Inf
 [6,]    2    1  Inf    1    2    0    2  Inf    2   Inf
 [7,]    4    3  Inf    1    2    2    0  Inf    2   Inf
 [8,]  Inf  Inf  Inf  Inf  Inf  Inf  Inf    0  Inf   Inf
 [9,]    4    3  Inf    1    1    2    2  Inf    0   Inf
[10,]  Inf  Inf    1  Inf  Inf  Inf  Inf  Inf  Inf     0
```

Since the decision function receives IDs of vertices, we can complicate our attribute data structure to contain vectors for each vertex:
```r
set.seed(42)
context <- list("1" = rnorm(100),
                "2" = rnorm(100),
                "3" = rnorm(100),
                "4" = rnorm(100),
                "5" = rnorm(100),
                "6" = rnorm(100),
                "7" = rnorm(100),
                "8" = rnorm(100),
                "9" = rnorm(100),
                "10"= rnorm(100))
```
Then, the decision function needs to be adapted to this new data structure:
```r
decision_fct <- function(strt, crnt, nxt){
  dist_angular_distance(context[[crnt]], context[[nxt]]) <=
    dist_angular_distance(context[[strt]], context[[nxt]])
}
```
This decision function makes use of built-in distance functions for numeric vectors. Using this, we could evaluate the betweenness centrality, for example:
```r
betw <- betweenness_ctx(g,decision_fct)
```
It results in the following betweenness values for the vertices:
```
 [1] 0.0000000 3.3750000 4.3333333 3.9583333 1.0416667 0.5000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.5833333 0.4583333
```

 abstract = {Centrality measurements are a well-known method to assess the importance of actors in networks. They are easy to obtain and provide a versatile interpretability adaptable to the meaning of nodes and edges. The current centrality measurements use structural information alone. In real-world situations, however, actors and the connections between them are subject to contextual settings and can be significantly influenced by these settings. In fact, such real-world observations are often modeled using attributed networks in which contextual information can be associated as attributes to nodes and edges. However, this information is disregarded when evaluating the importance of actors in terms of network centrality measurements. Hence, this paper proposes a method for obtaining shortest path-based centrality measurements for attributed networks that exploit attribute information on nodes for shortest path calculations. We add abstracts of scientific publications to a co-publishing network and use topic models to create node-individual context constraints for shortest path calculations. This creates additional analytic opportunities and can aid in gaining a detailed understanding of complex social networks.}
